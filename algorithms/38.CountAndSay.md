# 38. Count and Say

## Description

The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

* countAndSay(1) = "1"
* countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a
  different digit string.

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of groups so that each group is a
contiguous section all of the **same character**. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the
character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

For example, the saying and conversion for digit string "3322251":

### Example 1:

```
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 30
