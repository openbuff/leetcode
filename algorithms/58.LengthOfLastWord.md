# 58. Length of Last Word

## Description

Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = " "
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
* s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
