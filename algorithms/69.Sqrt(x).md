# 69. Sqrt(x)

## Description

Given a non-negative integer x,compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result
is returned.

### Example 1:

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

### Constraints:

* 0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

## Solution

* **java**
