# 9. Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
**Follow up**: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

### Example 1:

```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Example 4:

```
Input: x = -101
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

* -231 <= x <= 231 - 1
