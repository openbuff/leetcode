# 177. Nth Highest Salary

## Description

Write a SQL query to get the nth highest salary from the Employee table.

```
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest
salary, then the query should return null.

```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```
