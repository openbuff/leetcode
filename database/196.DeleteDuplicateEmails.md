# 196. Delete Duplicate Emails

## Description

Write a SQL query to delete all duplicate email entries in a table named Person, keeping only unique emails based on its
smallest Id.

```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Id is the primary key column for this table.
```

For example, after running your query, the above Person table should have the following rows:

```
+----+------------------+
| Id | Email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
```

**Note:**

Your output is the whole **Person** table after executing your sql. Use **delete** statement.
